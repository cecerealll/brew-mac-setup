# Setup a Mac

Setup config to take an empty mac and build out a decent programming environment with iterm and zsh and a host of other useful tools.

Uses mostly brew.  You should be able to run this straight from a brand new mac with a standard shell.

## Run it

Download the `setup.sh` file.

chmod it  `chmod +x setup.sh`

Run it `./setup.sh`

## Modify it

Most of the programs are set in the arrays at the top of the script using brew and brew cask.
Miro needed to have the .dmg downloaded and then mounted and extracted.
